**Border Animation README**

---

### Description:

This project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and a CSS file (`Style.css`) to create a border animation effect around a figure element. The animation utilizes keyframes to transition between different linear gradients for the border.

### Files Included:

1. **index.html**: 
   - This HTML file defines the structure of the webpage. It contains a `figure` element with a `figcaption` child element.

2. **Style.css**: 
   - This CSS file contains the styles for the HTML elements.
   - It defines the color scheme, layout properties, and animation keyframes for the border animation effect.

### Usage:

To use this border animation effect in your project:

1. Include the `index.html` and `Style.css` files in your project directory.
2. Link the `Style.css` file to your HTML file using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">`.
3. Customize the content inside the `figcaption` element as needed.
4. You can adjust the animation duration and colors by modifying the CSS in `Style.css` file.

### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        </figcaption>
    </figure>
</body>
</html>
```
